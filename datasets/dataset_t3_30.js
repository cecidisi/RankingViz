                "description":"This paper focuses on Mixed Reality (MR) visual displays, a particular subset of Virtual Reality (VR) related technologies that involve the merging of real and virtual worlds somewhere along the \"virtuality continuum\" which connects completely real environments to completely virtual ones. Probably the best known of these is Augmented Reality (AR), which refers to all cases in which the display of an otherwise real environment is augmented by means of virtual (computer graphic) objects. The converse case on the virtuality continuum is therefore Augmented Virtuality (AV). Six classes of hybrid MR display environments are identified. However, an attempt to distinguish these classes on the basis of whether they are primarily video or computer graphics based, whether the real world is viewed directly or via some electronic display medium, whether the viewer is intended to feel part of the world or on the outside looking in, and whether or not the scale of the display is intended to map orthoscopically onto the real world leads to quite different groupings among the six identified classes, thereby demonstrating the need for an efficient taxonomy, or classification framework, according to which essential differences can be identified. The 'obvious' distinction between the terms \"real\" and \"virtual\" is shown to have a number of different aspects, depending on whether one is dealing with real or virtual objects, real or virtual images, and direct or non-direct viewing of these. An (approximately) three dimensional taxonomy is proposed, comprising the following dimensions: Extent of World Knowledge (\"how much do we know about the world being displayed?\"), Reproduction Fidelity (\"how 'realistically' are we able to display it?\"), and Extent of Presence Metaphor (\"what is the extent of the illusion that the observer is present within that world?\"). key words: virtual reality (VR), augmented reality (AR), mixed reality (MR)",

                "description":"Close-range photogrammetry is based on the acquisition of imagery to make accurate measurements and, eventually, three-dimensional (3D) photo-realistic models. These models are a photogrammetric product per se. They are usually integrated into virtual reality scenarios where additional data such as sound, text or video can be introduced, leading to multimedia virtual environments. These environments allow users both to navigate and interact on different platforms such as desktop PCs, laptops and small hand-held devices (mobile phones or PDAs). In very recent years, a new technology derived from virtual reality has emerged: Augmented Reality (AR), which is based on mixing real and virtual environments to boost human interactions and real-life navigations. The synergy of AR and photogrammetry opens up new possibilities in the field of 3D data visualization, navigation and interaction far beyond the traditional static navigation and interaction in front of a computer screen. In this paper we introduce a low-cost outdoor mobile AR application to integrate buildings of different urban spaces. High-accuracy 3D photo-models derived from close-range photogrammetry are integrated in real (physical) urban worlds. The augmented environment that is presented herein requires for visualization a see-through video head mounted display (HMD), whereas user's movement navigation is achieved in the real world with the help of an inertial navigation sensor. After introducing the basics of AR technology, the paper will deal with real-time orientation and tracking in combined physical and virtual city environments, merging close-range photogrammetry and AR. There are, however, some software and complex issues, which are discussed in the paper. &amp;copy; 2009 International Society for Photogrammetry and Remote Sensing, Inc. (ISPRS).",

This scenario with impoverished appearance information, as opposed to using images of higher resolution, provides an appropriate venue for studying the role of context in recognition. In this paper, we explore the role of context for dense scene labeling in small images. Given a segmentation of an image, our algorithm assigns each segment to an object category based on the segmentpsilas appearance and contextual information. We explicitly model context between object categories through the use of relative location and relative scale, in addition to co-occurrence. We perform recognition tests on low and high resolution images, which vary significantly in the amount of appearance information present, using just the object appearance information, the combination of appearance and context, as well as just context without object appearance information (blind recognition). We also perform these tests in human studies and analyze our findings to reveal interesting patterns.

Recognizing an object in an image is difficult when images include occlusion, poor quality, noise or background clutter, and this task becomes even more challenging when many objects are present in the same scene. Several models for object categorization use appearance and context information from objects to improve recognition accuracy. Appearance information, based on visual cues, can successfully identify object classes up to a certain extent. Context information, based on the interaction among objects in the scene or global scene statistics, can help successfully disambiguate appearance inputs in recognition tasks. In this work we address the problem of incorporating different types of contextual information for robust object categorization in computer vision. We review different ways of using contextual information in the field of object categorization, considering the most common levels of extraction of context and the different levels of contextual interactions. We also examine common machine learning models that integrate context information into object recognition frameworks and discuss scalability, optimizations and possible future approaches. ?? 2010 Elsevier Inc.",

                "description":"Augmented reality (AR) has become a promising and fast-growing application of computer graphics over the course of the last years. Augmented reality systems overlay computer-generated graphical information over the view of the real world. Several main research challenges can be identified in the field of augmented reality. These are the design of advanced display devices (e.g., head-mounted displays), camera tracking, system design, user interaction, and rendering. While a major part of the previous work focused on the problems of system design, camera tracking, and applications of AR, this thesis puts a different emphasis on the relatively underrepresented aspect of rendering techniques. In this thesis, several novel methods for displaying augmented video streams are explored. In the first part of this thesis in Chapter 2, the design and implementation of a novel system for medical augmented reality are discussed. The ARGUS framework is a new augmented reality system based on a commercial surgical navigation device. Since it does not require any additional hardware components, a transition into the clinical practice can be facilitated. Several extensions of the basic framework are described, including a hybrid tracking scheme, a user interaction library, and amethod for handling occlusion. The latter algorithm makes it possible to correctly render the occlusion of graphical objects by the anatomy of the patient, leading to a more realistic and easily comprehensible output. This approach is one of the advanced rendering methods for augmented reality investigated in the context of this thesis. The second part of this thesis, Chapter 3, introduces the concept of stylized augmented reality, which applies artistic or illustrative stylization methods to augmented reality video streams. Since the same type of stylization is applied to virtual and real scene elements, they become difficult to distinguish. This way, a novel augmented reality experience is created, and possibly even a better immersion. Real-time algorithms for cartoon-like and painterly brush stroke stylization of augmented video streams are described. The exploitation of programmable graphics hardware for this purpose is discussed. Moreover, the results of a psychophysical study on the discernability of virtual objects in stylized augmented reality are presented. At the beginning of Chapter 4, which is the third part of this thesis, a novel illustrative visualization method is described. This new rendering algorithm for iso-surfaces and polygonal models generates an illustrative representation of a surface and structures hidden behind it. The method is designed for the programmable rendering pipelines of modern graphics hardware and is capable of displaying complex models in real-time. An extension of this newly developed illustrative display style was also applied to augmented reality video streams. This system constitutes another realization of the concept of stylized augmented reality.",

All the procedures must be done in real time. This paper proposes a method for augmented reality with a stereo vision sensor and a video see-through head-mounted display (HMD). It can synchronize the display timing between the virtual and real worlds so that the alignment error is reduced. The method calculates camera parameters from three markers in image sequences captured by a pair of stereo cameras mounted on the HMD. In addition, it estimates the real-world depth from a pair of stereo images in order to generate a composed image maintaining consistent occlusions between real and virtual objects. The depth estimation region is efficiently limited by calculating the position of the virtual object by using the camera parameters. Finally, we have developed a video see-through augmented reality system which mainly consists of a pair of stereo cameras mounted on the HMD and a standard graphics workstation. The feasibility of the system has been successfully demonstrated with experiments",

                "description":"Augmented reality (AR) is a live, direct or indirect, view of a physical, real-world environment whose elements are augmented by computer-generated sensory input such as sound, video, graphics or GPS data. It is related to a more general concept called mediated reality, in which a view of reality is modified (possibly even diminished rather than augmented) by a computer. As a result, the technology functions by enhancing one&amp;rsquo;s current perception of reality.[1] By contrast, virtual reality replaces the real world with a simulated one.[2][3] Augmentation is conventionally in real-time and in semantic context with environmental elements, such as sports scores on TV during a match. With the help of advanced AR technology (e.g. adding computer vision and object recognition) the information about the surrounding real world of the user becomes interactive and digitally manipulable. Artificial information about the environment and its objects can be overlaid on the real world.",

This poses two major problems: (a) determining the precise alignment of real and virtual coordinate frames for overlay, and (b) capturing the 3D environment including camera and object motions. The latter is important for interactive augmented reality applications where users can interact with both real and virtual objects. Here we address the problem of accurately tracking the 3D motion of a monocular camera in a known 3D environment and dynamically estimating the 3D camera location. We utilize fully automated landmark-based camera calibration to initialize the motion estimation and employ extended Kalman filter techniques to track landmarks and to estimate the camera location. The implementation of our approach has been proven to be efficient and robust and our system successfully tracks in real-time at approximately 10 Hz.",

Except a pair of video cameras, without any other sensors or artificial markers, users can use real rackets to hit virtual ping-pong ball on a virtual table and interact with remote partners in augmented reality scene just as they were playing ping-pong in the same place. First, the real racket can be detected and tracked in real-time in the video captured by a single camera in each site. By 3D registration, the real racket can seamlessly interact with the virtual ping-pong ball and table. Then, a communication scheme is designed for the consistent perception between users in collaborative augmented reality ping-pong system. To achieve real-time interaction, the whole method is implemented in a parallel computing environment through multi-core processors. Experimental results demonstrate that our system can provide consistent perception and natural user interaction with low latency and high precision.",

Some approaches apply a pseudo-DR, allowing for the removal of objects only, while their background can be observed by a second camera. Most real DR approaches are highly computational expensive, not even allowing for interactive rates and/or apply significant restrictions regarding the uniformity of the background, or allow linear camera movements or even a static camera only. In this paper we will present a real-time capable Diminished Reality approach for high-quality image manipulation. Our approach achieves a significantly better performance and image quality for almost planar but non-trivial image backgrounds. Our Diminished Reality pipeline provides coherent video streams even for nonlinear camera movements due to the integration of homography based object tracking.",

                "description":"Diminished reality is as important as augmented reality, and both are possible with a device called the Reality Mediator. Over the past two decades, we have designed, built, worn, and tested many different embodiments of this device in the context of wearable computing. Incorporated into the Reality Mediator is an &ldquo;EyeTap&rdquo; system, which is a device that quantifies and resynthesizes light that would otherwise pass through one or both lenses of the eye(s) of a wearer. The functional principles of EyeTap devices are discussed, in detail. The EyeTap diverts into a spatial measurement system at least a portion of light that would otherwise pass through the center of projection of at least one lens of an eye of a wearer. The Reality Mediator has at least one mode of operation in which it reconstructs these rays of light, under the control of a wearable computer system. The computer system then uses new results in algebraic projective geometry and comparametric equations to perform head tracking, as well as to track motion of rigid planar patches present in the scene. We describe how our tracking algorithm allows an EyeTap to alter the light from a particular portion of the scene to give rise to a computer-controlled, selectively mediated reality. An important difference between mediated reality and augmented reality includes the ability to not just augment but also deliberately diminish or otherwise alter the visual perception of reality. For example, diminished reality allows additional information to be inserted without causing the user to experience information overload. Our tracking algorithm also takes into account the effects of automatic gain control, by performing motion estimation in both spatial as well as tonal motion coordinates.",

Diminished reality can be considered an important part of many mixed and augmented reality applications. Our target application is the use of augmented reality (AR) to revamp procedures in industrial plants. An object or a region of interest is delineated on a single reference image. A paraperspective projection model is used to generate the correct background from multiple calibrated views of the scene. We propose methods to deal with approximately planar backgrounds with different orientations. We also propose a multi-resolution approach to deal with non-planar backgrounds. Different sets of experimental results demonstrate the success and limits of the algorithms. Results on real data from water treatment and power plants show the usefulness of this method for industrial applications.",

We demonstrate the strength of the approach on a range of recognition tasks: From invariant single object recognition in clutter to multiclass categorization problems and complex scene understanding tasks that rely on the recognition of both shape-based as well as texture-based objects. Given the biological constraints that the system had to satisfy, the approach performs surprisingly well: It has the capability of learning from only a few training examples and competes with state-of-the-art systems. We also discuss the existence of a universal, redundant dictionary of features that could handle the recognition of most object categories. In addition to its relevance for computer vision, the success of this approach suggests a plausibility proof for a class of feedforward models of object recognition in cortex.",

To evaluate this initial approach, we conducted a proof of concept usability test under a set of scenarios such as &amp;amp;amp;#x201C;Exploring objects behind the user&amp;amp;amp;#x201D;, &amp;amp;amp;#x201C;Avoiding the invasion of personal space&amp;amp;amp;#x201D; and &amp;amp;amp;#x201C;Walk and type with front-view.&amp;amp;amp;#x201D; Through this initial examination, we found that users can explore off-screen point of interests and grasp the spatial relations without the increase of mental effort. We believe that this preliminary study gives a meaningful indication that employing the interactive field of view can be a useful method to decrease the physical load without any additional mental efforts in a mixed and augmented reality environment.",

Our first interface combines three technologies: augmented reality (AR), immersive virtual reality (VR), and computer vision-based hand and object tracking. Wearing a lightweight display with an attached camera, users can look at a real map and see three-dimensional virtual terrain models overlaid on the map. From this AR interface, they can fly in and experience the model immersively, or use free hand gestures or physical markers to change the data representation. Building on this work, our second interface explores alternative interface techniques, including a zoomable user interface, paddle interactions, and pen annotations. We describe the system hardware and software and the implications for GIS and spatial science applications.",

It describes the  medical, manufacturing, visualization, path planning, entertainment and military applications that have been explored. This paper describes the characteristics of  Augmented Reality systems, including a detailed discussion of the tradeoffs between optical and video blending approaches. Registration and sensing errors are two of the biggest problems in building effective Augmented Reality systems, so this paper summarizes current efforts to overcome these problems. Future directions and areas  requiring further research are discussed. This survey provides a starting point for anyone interested in researching or using Augmented Reality.",

                "description":"A common effect of aging is decline in spatial cognition. This is an issue for all elders, but particularly for elder drivers. To address this driving issue, we propose a novel concept of an in-vehicle navigation display system that displays navigation information directly onto the vehicle's windshield, superimposing it on the driver's view of the actual road. An evaluation of our simulated version of this display shows that it results in a significant reduction in navigation errors and distraction-related measures compared to a typical in-car navigation display for elder drivers. These results help us understand how context-sensitive information and a simulated augmented reality representation can be combined to minimize the cognitive load in translating between virtual/information spaces and the real world.",

                "description":"Augmented Reality combines real world and virtual information in interactive visualizations. Since phones started integrating GPS, compass and accelerometer, several Augmented Reality browsers for phones have hit the market. These are applications that access large amounts of geo-referenced information from online sources and present it at corresponding physical locations, superimposed onto a live video stream. However, Augmented Reality is constrained by the camera's field of view and restricted to first- person views, limiting the amount of overview that users can gain. We present two zooming interfaces that compensate for these constraints by enabling users to smoothly zoom between the Augmented Reality view and (1) an egocentric panoramic view of 360, and (2) an exocentric top-down view. We present the results from two studies that show how in most search tasks our zooming interfaces are faster and require less panning than an overlay- based tool, scaling better as the amount of information grows.",
